# Description

Psychology is most powerful when it‚Äôs applied outside the classroom. For your final project, you‚Äôll choose a format that allows you to **demonstrate your understanding of a key psychological topic** in a creative or analytical way. This is your chance to **dive deeper into a concept that interested you**, and communicate what you‚Äôve learned clearly and effectively.
