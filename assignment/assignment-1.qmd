## Description

For this assignment, you will be asked to create a video introducing yourself to the instructor. I know that it can be really awkward to just talk to your computer, so you will only be required to be on camera when introducing yourself. This is an opportunity for me to get to know you as well as needing to meet the RIT requirement for online courses.

## Rubric

Create a brief video (under 5 minutes is fine) that includes your answers to the following questions:

1.  Your Name
2.  Your Pronouns
3.  Your Major
4.  What is a TV show, movie, book or album that you have recently watched/read/listened to that you really enjoyed?
5.
