I will ask each student to create a brief video introducing themselves (rubric will be posted). These will only be seen by the instructor. This introduction is a requirement by RIT for online courses as we need to confirm you are who you say you are (but I also want to get to know my students).\nDuring the first unit, you will also need to complete a brief quiz on the syllabus.\n\n\n\nTo help solidify the material and identify areas that you can focus your study, there will be regular quizzes consisting of multiple choice and short answer questions. These will be posted to myCourses and can be taken at any point prior to the deadline. All quizzes will become available at the beginning of the semester. Each quizwill have a specific time limit. The quizzes will only cover the information from that specific topic (i.e., non-cumulative). Quizzes will be open-note.\n\n\n\nThe assignments for this class will consist of utilizing your knowledge of the topic and applying it to various examples in the real world. Each assignment will be related to a topic in the course, but will also allow you to incorporate information across multiple topics. The assignments will have different structures with some consisting inf written responses and others to incorporate other creative components. The goal of the assignments is to move beyond the textbook and classroom to investigate the application of psychology and to think like a psychologist.\n\n\n\nTo help bring the discussion beyond the class, there will be the expectation that you will create and engage with discussion posts (2 created & 1 response). The posts will focus on an area of psychology that is of interest to you. The goal of these posts is for you to share information that you have gathered from elsewhere and bring in to provide some additional information. Topics of these discussions can vary from examining the science behind pop-science articles, reflecting on reading a scientific study, identifying a popular myth in psychology and describing why it is a myth. More information will be available on myCourses/course site to highlight the specific content and expectations.\n\n\n\nThe course will culminate in a final project that will be completed individually. You have the ability to choose the type of project you would like to complete. I want this to be a time for you to bring in any other creative elements that you would like. If you have other ideas for a type of project, please let me know. I am happy to update to accommodate your ideas if they continue to fit the expectations of the project. More information will be provided.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUseful info\nSONA Director: Dr. Dustin Haraden\nEmail: sona@rit.edu\nInformation website (for more guidance): https://ritpsych.github.io/sona/\nSona website (for signing up for studies): https://rit.sona-systems.com\n\n\n\nEvery PSYC101 student must earn 8 Sona credits. You earn 1 credit per 15 minutes of participation, plus a bonus credit for face-to-face studies, so this will take you a maximum of 2 hours to complete. To earn Sona credits, you must sign up for studies through the psychology department’s Sona website. Other research will not qualify.\n\nYour participation must be complete by 5pm on the last day of classes (i.e., the day before Reading Day). At that time, if you have NOT earned at least 8 credits, your final grade will be dropped by one “step” – that is, from A to A-, from B- to C+, or from D to F. There is no partial credit and there are no exceptions.\nGrade Scheme\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGrade\nA\nA-\nB+\nB\nB-\nC+\nC\nC-\nD\nF\n\n\n\n\nPercentage\n93+\n90-92\n87-89\n83-86\n80-82\n77-79\n73-76\n70-72\n60-69\n&lt;60\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“A Wizard is never late, nor are they early.

Due to the accelerated nature of the course, the late penalty will be more severe. There will be a 50% deduction on the first day. Work will not be accepted beyond 24 hours after the deadline.\n\n\n\nRIT is committed to providing academic adjustments to students with disabilities. If you would like to request academic adjustments such as testing modifications due to a disability, please contact the Disability Services Office. Contact information for the DSO and information about how to request adjustments can be found at www.rit.edu/dso. After you receive academic adjustment approval, it is imperative that you contact me as early as possible so that we can work out whatever arrangement is necessary.\n\n\n\nAs an instructor, I have a mandatory reporting responsibility as a part of my role. It is my goal that you feel comfortable sharing information related to your life experiences in classroom discussions, in your written work, and in our one-on-one meetings. I will seek to keep the information you share private to the greatest extent possible. However, I am required to report information I receive regarding sexual misconduct or information about a crime that may have occurred during your time at RIT. \n\n\n\nRIT is committed to providing a safe learning environment, free of harassment and discrimination as articulated in our university policies located on our governance website. RIT’s policies require faculty to share information about incidents of gender-based discrimination and harassment with RIT’s Title IX coordinator or deputy coordinators when incidents are stated to them directly. The information you provide to a non-confidential resource which includes faculty will be relayed only as necessary for the Title IX Coordinator to investigate and/or seek resolution. Even RIT Offices and employees who cannot guarantee confidentiality will maintain your privacy to the greatest extent possible.\nIf an individual discloses information during a public awareness event, a protest, during a class project, or advocacy event, RIT is not obligated to investigate based on this public disclosure. RIT may however use this information to further educate faculty, staff and students about prevention efforts and available resources.\nIf you would like to report an incident of gender based discrimination or harassment directly you may do so by using the online Sexual Harassment, Discrimination and Sexual Misconduct Reporting or anonymously by using the Compliance and Ethics Hotline. If you have a concern related to gender-based discrimination and/or harassment and prefer to have a confidential discussion, assistance is available from any of RIT’s confidential resources (listed below).\n\nRIT Counseling and Psychological Services\n\n585-475-2261 (V)\n585-475-6897 (TTY)\nwww.rit.edu/counseling\n\nNTID Counseling and Academic Advising\n\n585-475-6400\nwww.ntid.rit.edu/counselingdept\n\nRIT Student Health Center\n\n585-475-2255 (V)\nwww.rit.edu/studentaffairs/studenthealth\n\nCenter for Religious Life\n\n585-475-2137\nwww.rit.edu/studentaffairs/religion\n\nRIT Ombuds Office\n\n585-475-7357\n585-475-6424\n585-286-4677 (VP)\nwww.rit.edu/ombuds/contact-us\n\n\n\n\n\nAs an institution of higher learning, RIT expects students to behave honestly and ethically at all times, especially when submitting work for evaluation in conjunction with any course or degree requirement. The Department of Psychology encourages all students to become familiar with the RIT Honor Code and with RIT’s Academic Integrity Policy. RIT’s policy on academic integrity requires the instructor to investigate of any suspected breach of academic integrity. If the preponderance of evidence indicates a breach of academic integrity, the student who did so may incur a consequence up to and including failure for the entire course.\nAbout Generative AI\nEach course that you are involved in will have differing opinions and goals regarding generative AI (i.e., ChatGPT, Gemini, Perplexity, Claude, etc.). In this course you are allowed to use these as a tool. You can use prompts such as “Teach me about (insert psych topic here) and give me an example that might apply to me.” If you do use generative AI, I would like for you to disclose that information just so I can have a sense of how it is being used. If I suspect that the work that you have turned in is using AI, we will have to have a conversation to determine the next steps. Turning in AI work is considered plagiarism, and you may be asked to re-do the assignment, or possibly receive a 0 on the assignment.\n\n\n\nRIT is committed to the safety of the RIT community and beyond. Because the situation is still in a rapid state of change, checking the RIT Ready website, and specifically the RIT Safety Plan for the most up to date information is recommended: https://www.rit.edu/ready/rit-safety-plan.\n\n\n\nI have provided this syllabus as a guide to our course and have made every attempt to provide an accurate overview of the course. However, as instructor, I reserve the right to modify this document during the semester, if necessary, to ensure that we achieve course learning objectives.
